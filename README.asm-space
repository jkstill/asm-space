It is assumed that ASM conventions for naming data files are followed.

eg: +DG/dbname/filetype/...

This information is used to get the diskgroup name and database name from the full path name.
While the diskgroup name is available in v$ask_diskgroup the SQL JOIN to get it is not very 
efficient (quite slow), and so it is derived from the full path name.

The database name is not directly available, and is also derived from the full path name.

The full path name is taken from v$alias with a connect-by-path.

File types found in v$asm_file

All file types will be captured.
The following files types are most associated with DB and progressive space consumption and 
should be considered when tracking sizes for growth.
